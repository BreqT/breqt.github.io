      <p>It's important to make your VR headset feel like it's really yours. There are a number of ways to customize your headset so that it looks and feels just right!</p>
      <h2>Skins</h2>
      <p>Many companies offer skins for both the headset and the controllers. A common theme is putting eyes and a face on the front of the headset since it's worn over the head.</p>
      <p>Controller skins are great for remembering which one is right and which one is left. Many people also use bumpers on their controllers to both customize and protect them.</p>
      <h2>Audio</h2>
      <p>Oculus' new headsets have all featured built in speakers but no headphones. While this is great for being able to hear what's going on around you, many people prefer the immersion of true headphones covering their ears.</p>
      <p>The Quest headsets have audio jacks on the sides which allow for headphones to be plugged in. Many people find putting headphones over a VR headset uncomfortable, though, so a solution users came up with was to use the HTC Vive deluxe audio strap with the Quest.</p>
      <p>Another less popular option is to use the earbuds Oculus designed for the quest, though earbuds provide less imersion than headphones and make it more difficult to locate the source of a sound.</p>
