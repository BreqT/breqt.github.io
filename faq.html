        <h2>Do I need a PC to play VR?</h2>
        <p>Nope! For many years, getting into VR meant first saving up money and building a high end gaming PC, but with Oculus' new headset line, the Quest and Quest 2, you can play VR with just the headset itself. No PC or cables required.</p><br>
        <h2>Will I get sick from VR?</h2>
        <p>It's relatively common for new players to experience a phenomenon referred to as "VR sickness" where the user feels the effects of motion sickness but often amplified and longer lasting. Typically this goes away after the person gets used to VR, which can take anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks.</p><br>
        <h2>How do I use my Quest with a PC?</h2>
        <p>You can connect an Oculus Quest to a PC using a USB 3.0 to USB type C cable, and it will show up in the Oculus software. Otherwise, you can sideload an update for Virtual Desktop (make sure to buy the Quest version!) which allows VR games to work over wifi. With decent wifi, the latency is so low it's nearly the same as wired.</p><br>
        <h2>Do we have Ready Player One technology yet?</h2>
        <p>So far, companies have produced haptic vests, haptic gloves, and even a VR treadmill identical to that seen in Ready Player One. While we don't yet have full haptic suits, consumer haptic vests have actually started to come out, and many games can be modded to support them.</p><br>
        <h2>Can I exercise with VR?</h2>
        <p>Yep! There are many high intensity games out there, such as Beat Saber, FitXR, Echo VR, and even maps within RecRoom.</p>
